# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about).

Run `yarn install` to get set up,
then run `yarn run advent xx`,
where `xx` is a day number (like `03`)
to run an individual day's solution.
Run `yarn run watch xx` to continuously re-compile and re-run a day's solution.
